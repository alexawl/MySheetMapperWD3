Mapbox's [Sheet Mapper](https://www.mapbox.com/impact-tools/sheet-mapper) using D3.js instead of Tabletop.js


> Create a live-updating map that displays the locations of all of your POIs or events, powered by a simple spreadsheet.


As of September 2020, Google is retiring v3 of the Sheets API and Tabletop.js will no longer work. The creator recommends using the [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/) library instead.



_NOTE:_ With the change to D3.js, this sample cannot be run directly from an HTML file on your local disk. You need to run it off a server, local or online
